It became apparent to these scholars that a large computer database had many advantages over traditional methods of publication for such a project. The group was widened to include specialists in Hebrew, related languages and linguistics from several European countries and from Israel, and an outline plan was agreed. In 1991 the European Science Foundation agreed to establish and fund a Scientific Network on \u201cThe Semantics of Classical Hebrew\u201d under the chairmanship of Professor J. Hoftijzer (Leiden) for three years, so that both theoretical and practical aspects of the design of a semantic database for an ancient language could be explored. These preliminary investigations were carried out in three workshops (Strasbourg, June-July 1992; Florence, April 1993; Cambridge, September 1993 - see Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Althebr\u00e4istik VI/1 (1993) and VII/1 (1994)) and a Symposium (Leiden, July 1994), and a detailed plan for future work was agreed. In February 1994 the Standing Committee for the Humanities of the European Science Foundation expressed its satisfaction with the activities of the Network and recommended them as being \u201cof great intellectual significance and worthy of being assisted in the next stage of its work\u201d. [Further details of the work of the Scientific Network can be found in the ESF publication Scientific Networks (1993), pp. 46-47.] This document was originally prepared and approved by the Co-ordinating Committee of the Scientific Network (which is what is referred to in what follows as \u201cThe Committee\u201d), but it has been revised and agreed by the Executive Committee which will in future be responsible for the direction of the project (see the section below on Organisation). Aim of the Project It is not the aim of the project to add a new kind of dictionary to the already existing ones, nor to tackle a semantic study on the basis of a special method or methods. Its purpose is to prepare a tool which can be a useful inducement to further semantic research. It will provide a badly needed survey of the results and arguments found in scholarly literature. Thus it will prevent for everyone who uses it the loss of valuable time. Moreover it is planned in such a way that it will be clear not only what work has already been done, but also which workable way of approach has not been used for the study of the lexeme in question. In this way it will stimulate future research by drawing attention to what needs to be done and it will act as a stimulus to fresh, original research. It goes without saying that particularly research in which modern types of approach are used will be encouraged. Organisation These aims can only be realised by international co-operation. The following European universities (represented by the scholars named) have so far indicated their readiness to establish centres for the work of the project, should the necessary funding be obtained: Bonn (Prof. Dr. H.-J. Fabry), Cambridge (Dr. G.I. Davies), Dublin (Prof. Dr. K.J. Cathcart), Florence (Prof. Dr. I. Zatelli), Leiden (Prof. Dr. T. Muraoka and Dr. K. Jongeling), Leuven (Prof. Dr. A. Schoors, Prof. Dr. M. Vervenne and Dr. P. Swiggers), Oxford (Prof. Dr. H.G.M. Williamson) and Paris (Prof. Dr. A. Lemaire). Each of these centres will have responsibility for a lexical field or a number of lexical fields (by \u2018lexical field\u2019 is meant a group of lexemes which have a distinct mutual sense-relation). This approach is preferable because the subdividing of the lexical material in this way lends coherence to the description and study of the individual lexemes. For these centres two levels of central management will be needed: a) an Executive Committee consisting of representatives of the associated centres, which will oversee the actual running of the project. b) an Advisory Group, which will include representatives of the ESF and the other funding bodies and some additional specialists in the field. One centre will be responsible for the construction and maintenance of the database. It will also undertake the programming necessary for the systematic organisation of the input of the database, make bibliographic provisions and oversee the dating and classification of texts. It will, like the other centres, have responsibility for a lexical field or fields. Leiden has been chosen to be this centre. Every centre will have one or more salaried co-workers. The work on the database can be completed in 10 to 12 years. This period will be subdivided into phases, each phase with its own objective. Scope It has been agreed that the project will concentrate on the language of all texts in Ancient Hebrew: the Hebrew Bible, the Ancient Hebrew inscriptions, the Hebrew text of Ben Sira and the Hebrew Qumran texts. Semantic Methods At the first workshop of the Scientific Network a thorough survey was given of the different types of semantic approach which are used (or: can be used) for the study of Ancient Hebrew. Particular attention was given to the question of the problems which arise when these approaches are used for the semantic description of a language (phase), like Ancient Hebrew, which we only know through a relatively small corpus of texts. The presupposition of the work proposed is that each of these approaches offers as such a legitimate way of tackling semantic problems and that each of them can contribute to a smaller or larger extent to their solution. Framework In the database the arguments and results of semantic scholarly work will be collected in one framework, no matter which method or methods were used in the relevant publications or by the co-workers on the project themselves. For such a database a framework is needed in which the relevant data for each lexeme will be collected. This framework will reflect current insights into the relevant methods and their problems. It will be clear that, in view of the varied kinds of scholarly approach, a neutral way of describing the results arrived at by the application of each of them is needed. In this respect it appeared helpful to subdivide the framework into sections: for each line of approach (or: for a combination of related lines of approach) a separate section. In each of these sections the relevant results of scholarly work can be described according to the neutral descriptional method. During the second and third workshops of the Scientific Network a decision was reached on the definitive form of this framework. In this framework system sections dedicated to lexical fields will also be added. The division of the framework into sections helps to keep it surveyable and well-organised. In a final section a general survey will be given of the results reached in the other sections. Descriptional method During the second workshop a neutral descriptional method was accepted which formally, to outward appearance, is the same as that used for componential analysis, without the presuppositions of this kind of approach. This componential description of the results found in scholarly literature should be clearly distinguished from componential analysis as a linguistic approach to semantic studies and from the theories embraced by its practitioners. The use of this descriptional method for the aims of the database is possible because it can easily be adapted for the description of the results of other methods than the one it was designed for originally. Material included In view of the relative uncertainty of nearly every solution in our field it was considered wise to be extremely careful before leaving out scholarly proposals and/or arguments as being invalid. This does not mean that results and arguments of scholarly work ought to be inserted indiscriminately into the framework. Each section (except the final one) will be subdivided into two subsections. In the first one those results and arguments are collected which after assessment are considered to be convincing, in the second one the other material. Multi-dimensional approach During the second workshop it was decided that for the database the more sophisticated approach of a multi-dimensional nature was to be preferred, because it offers possibilities for the combination of data from different parts of one framework or from different frameworks, while leaving open the possibility of making printouts of every lexeme entry, which will always remain helpful. It was the opinion of the committee that the database should be maintained in ASCII format to keep it independent of operating systems and programs that might change over the years. During the third workshop there was presented a pilot project, in which demonstrations were given of how such a multi-dimensional approach could work in practice. Terminology For a database system it is of course necessary to use a uniform system of general, basic terms. Such a system was discussed during the third workshop. It was decided to explore the possibility of the use of the descriptive terminology recently developed by a member of the Committee, Prof. Richter from Munich, on the basis of modern research. A list of grammatical and descriptional terms has been formulated, which can be used when the work on the database starts, also on the basis of the material provided by Prof. Richter. In this way one can ensure a real coherence for the database work and an effective co-ordination of the work of the different centres. The idea is that the input should be done according to the framework system, but the implementation will be such that the output will not be, as far as possible, defined by it. An offer of Dr. Burnard, a specialist in this field from Oxford, to make an analysis of the framework, using the proposed terminological system, in terms of SGML has been gladly accepted by the Committee. Hierarchic approach To guarantee a satisfactory use of the multi-dimensional approach the introduction of a hierarchic code system is desirable. One could present a fixed code system with a hierarchic structure. However, in this way we would commit ourselves to one semantic approach, excluding other approaches, which would be undesirable. Therefore an approach which gives users the opportunity to make their own choices is preferable, because it makes many different approaches possible. In this way future users can approach a problem from e.g. a formal grammatical or a notional standpoint, according to their own wishes. Such a construction, which is technically possible, will be used for the database project. The instructions for the co-workers The future co-workers on the database project need to be given a set of basic rules. For fruitful co-operation within each centre and among the centres it is of vital importance to have at one\u2019s disposal a set of rules which guarantees a uniform approach on a number of central points. Such a set of rules was presented at the third workshop, and agreement was reached about the definitive text. The co-workers will also be provided (by the organizing centre) with a bibliography containing basic lists of commentaries, handbooks to be consulted, agreed abbreviations and, wherever necessary, advice on the use of existing bibliographical reference works. Works not included in the range defined could be found and be referred to if they are cited in the primary selection of literature. The co-workers will also be provided with the framework text (with short introductory remarks), with the list of descriptional terms mentioned above and with a number of sample entries. These sample entries will be provided to avoid unnecessary and undesirable variation. There will be some scope for co-workers to add the results of their own research to what is found in the existing literature. But it is not their first task to supply answers to open questions. It is important that non-experts should not try to add material in specialised fields if they do not know them well (one could, for instance, think here of certain types of etymology and of the ancient translation of the Hebrew Bible, the Versions). In appropriate cases means for publication have already been offered by the Zeitschrift fr Althebr\u00e4istik and by the series Arbeiten zu Text und Sprache im Alten Testament. Tagged Bible text The Committee wants to avoid overlapping with work already done by others. So, for instance, morphologically tagged Bible texts are in existence. During the third workshop Prof. Richter suggested the use of the tagged Bible text prepared by his institute in Munich. The Committee has considered this text acceptable for use by the co-workers on the database. It goes without saying that legal advice has to be sought on the copyright issues. A one-to- one rendering of the codes of this Bible text in English (which will be the language of the project) will be necessary. Moreover, the use of the Munich Bible text will be very helpful, because it was based on a manuscript text with Tiberian vocalisation, but was coded in such a way that it could also be viewed without the vocalisation and punctuation (added in the second half of the first millennium A.D.) and even without so-called matres lectionis (consonant signs used for indication of vowels already in the first millennium B.C. and partly added into the text later on). So comments in the database could be based on all these forms of the texts. Specialists It goes without saying that for cases where help from specialists is needed (for etymology, for instance, from Egyptologists, Akkadian scholars or Iranists), every centre (or group of centres) will look for their own specialists. In some cases it may be possible for a university which is not a main centre of the project to be associated with it for the purpose of giving specialist advice on such matters. Relations with other fields Although the project deals with the semantics of Ancient Hebrew, this does not mean that it will remain out of touch with the work of scholars in fields with a related character and related problems. Some such scholars were guests at the second and third workshops, and one of them gave a lecture at the latter workshop. We have learned from their experiences. The system designed by us is designed in such a way that, with some slight adaptations, it can also be applied to at least a number of their fields. We have considered this to be a second, very important, task. The system proved to be suitable not only for the semantic presentation of older Semitic languages (especially those known only through a relatively small corpus of texts), but also for the semantic presentation of a non-Semitic language like Old Armenian. Costs The main costs to be borne by each centre will be the salary costs of the research worker(s) there. Some provision will also need to be made for expenditure on equipment, reference works, consumables, travel (to meetings of the Executive Committee) etc. Each centre will calculate its requirements in accordance with local circumstances. In addition there will be some central costs to which it is hoped that each centre will make some contribution. These central costs will include the expenses of occasional meetings of the Advisory Group and the cost of services provided by the Leiden centre to the project as a whole, such as computer programming, handling and checking of material sent in by co-workers elsewhere, and the classification of biblical (and other) texts. There is a possibility that much of these central costs will be funded by a special grant. Drafted by J. Hoftijzer (Chair) and G. I.

It is important that non-experts should not try to add material in specialised fields if they do not know them well (one could, for instance, think here of certain types of etymology and of the ancient translation of the Hebrew Bible, the Versions). In appropriate cases means for publication have already been offered by the Zeitschrift fr Althebr\u00e4istik and by the series Arbeiten zu Text und Sprache im Alten Testament.","title":"The instructions for the co-workers"},{"location":"miscellaneous/project_description/#tagged-bible-text","text":"The Committee wants to avoid overlapping with work already done by others. So, for instance, morphologically tagged Bible texts are in existence. During the third workshop Prof. Richter suggested the use of the tagged Bible text prepared by his institute in Munich. The Committee has considered this text acceptable for use by the co-workers on the database. It goes without saying that legal advice has to be sought on the copyright issues. A one-to- one rendering of the codes of this Bible text in English (which will be the language of the project) will be necessary. Moreover, the use of the Munich Bible text will be very helpful, because it was based on a manuscript text with Tiberian vocalisation, but was coded in such a way that it could also be viewed without the vocalisation and punctuation (added in the second half of the first millennium A.D.) and even without so-called matres lectionis (consonant signs used for indication of vowels already in the first millennium B.C. and partly added into the text later on). So comments in the database could be based on all these forms of the texts.","title":"Tagged Bible text"},{"location":"miscellaneous/project_description/#specialists","text":"It goes without saying that for cases where help from specialists is needed (for etymology, for instance, from Egyptologists, Akkadian scholars or Iranists), every centre (or group of centres) will look for their own specialists.

Some such scholars were guests at the second and third workshops, and one of them gave a lecture at the latter workshop. We have learned from their experiences. The system designed by us is designed in such a way that, with some slight adaptations, it can also be applied to at least a number of their fields. We have considered this to be a second, very important, task. The system proved to be suitable not only for the semantic presentation of older Semitic languages (especially those known only through a relatively small corpus of texts), but also for the semantic presentation of a non-Semitic language like Old Armenian.","title":"Relations with other fields"},{"location":"miscellaneous/project_description/#costs","text":"The main costs to be borne by each centre will be the salary costs of the research worker(s) there. Some provision will also need to be made for expenditure on equipment, reference works, consumables, travel (to meetings of the Executive Committee) etc. Each centre will calculate its requirements in accordance with local circumstances. In addition there will be some central costs to which it is hoped that each centre will make some contribution. These central costs will include the expenses of occasional meetings of the Advisory Group and the cost of services provided by the Leiden centre to the project as a whole, such as computer programming, handling and checking of material sent in by co-workers elsewhere, and the classification of biblical (and other) texts. There is a possibility that much of these central costs will be funded by a special grant. Drafted by J. Hoftijzer (Chair) and G. I.

Another weight mentioned in its direct context is the shekel (\u2192 \u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05b6\u05e7\u05b6\u05dc). The beka is even equated with a half shekel in Exod 38:26. This use seems to agree with the custom of expressing the worth of precious goods in terms of weight, whereas an amount of food was described on the basis of its size or volume.\u00b2\u2074 Exegesis 6.1 Literal Use A.1 The word \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2has the basic meaning \u2018split off\u2019, \u2018piece\u2019, \u2018part\u2019,\u00b2\u2075 and in Exod 38:26 it is a \u2018part\u2019 (from two parts) of a shekel.\u00b2\u2076 A.2 The designation \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2is mentioned as a weight in Gen 24:22: Abraham\u2019s servant gives rich gifts to Rebeccah. He takes (\u05dc\u05e7\u05d7) a golden ring (\u05e0\u05b6\u05d6\u05b6\u05dd \u05d6\u05b8\u05b8\u05d4\u05b8\u05d1), whose weight (\u05de\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05b8\u05e7\u05b8\u05dc) is a \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2, as well as two bracelets, which have ten golden shekels (\u05e2\u05b2\u05e9\u05b8\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d6\u05b8\u05b8\u05d4\u05b8\u05d1; cf. \u2192 \u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05b6\u05e7\u05b6\u05dc) as their weight. The use ofbeka weighs only a portion of a shekel. \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2for a ring, next to \u2018ten shekels\u2019 for bracelets, suggests that a a beka weighs only a portion of a shekel. A.3 In Exod 38:26 a \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2is mentioned in the context of the mention of silver (\u05db\u05b6\u05bc\u05b6\u05e1\u05b6\u05e3, Exod 38:25) belonging to the processed materials (Exod 38:24-31) in the manufacture of the tabernacle and was gathered in a census. This is referred to as a \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2in silver a head for every one who was numbered in the census from the age of twenty years old and upwards. A \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2is further referred to in 38:26 as half a shekel (\u05de\u05b7 \u05d7\u05b2\u05b4\u05e6\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea\u05d4\u05b7\ufb49\u05b6\u05c1\u05b6\u05e7\u05b6\u05dc, \u2018half of a shekel\u2019) \u2018by the sanctuary shekel\u2019 (\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05b6\u05e7\u05b6\u05dc \u2192 ,\u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05e7\u05b6\u05dc \u05d4\u05b7\u05e8\u05bc\u05b9\u05b6\u05d3\u05b6\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1). 6.2 Figurative Use Not attested. 6.3 Pictorial Material A.1 Some pictures or drawings of beka weights have been published in the literature on the subject.\u00b2\u2077 Two of these are presented below (figs. 1 and 2), of which the round, stone weight is the most usual exemplar of this weight. Figure 1: Stone beka-weight\u00b2\u2078 Figure 2: Metal beka-weight\u00b2\u2079 A.2 A First Temple period beka weight was discovered during the sifting project of archaeological soil originating from the Western Wall foundations in the Emek Tzurim National Park under auspices of the City of David Foundation. The finding is interesting, because the weight was inscribed in mirror script (see Fig.1, below), which suggests that the craftsman was used to create seals and to write in mirror script.\u00b3\u2070 [][] Figure 3: Beka weight inscribed in mirror script.\u00b3\u00b9 6.4 Archaeology A.1 Kletter mentions thirty-five weights designated with the letters \u05e7 ,\u05d1, and \u05e2(or two or one of these letters) as a \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2.\u00b3\u00b2 Their provenance is, as far as it is known, for the most part in Judah, they date from the late 8th century BCE, and later centuries and vary according to its calculation in weight from 5.51 to about 6.90 grams, with an average of 6,003 grams.\u00b3\u00b3 These weights, all homogeneous in shape, are as a rule made of stone as all weights were,\u00b3\u2074 although a metal weight is found as well.\u00b3\u2075 It is also possible to point out a number of uninscribed beka weights (6.0-6.6 grams, mostly of stone), of which it is difficult to say whether they date from the same or an earlier period.\u00b3\u2076 \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2beka (half a shekel) 5 Conclusion A.1 The \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2, \u2019half shekel\u2019, is part of a weight system that is based on the \u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05b6\u05e7\u05b6\u05dc. The fact that the found beka weights vary in weight is attributed to the existence of more than one weight standard.\u00b3\u2077 However, it can also be explained by factors such as mistakes in the manufacture of the weights, inability to accurately weigh, wear and tamper.\u00b3\u2078 Since the found beka weights originate from the same time and, as far as is known, come largely from the same area (Judaea) and are largely homogeneous in terms of material and shape, it is probable that these weights are of the same weight standard.\u00b3\u2079 It is therefore very likely that the same weight standard is to be applied to the \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2of Gen 24:22 and the one of Exod 38:26. It is true that for the \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2of Exod 38:26, unlike that of Gen 24:22, the standard of the \u2018sanctuary shekel\u2019 applies. But the question is whether this is a standard set by the sanctuary that would deviate from that which is used in the normal use of the shekel (see \u2192 \u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05b6\u05e7\u05b6\u05dc).

Another weight mentioned in its direct context is the shekel (\u2192 \u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05b6\u05e7\u05b6\u05dc). The beka is even equated with a half shekel in Exod 38:26. This use seems to agree with the custom of expressing the worth of precious goods in terms of weight, whereas an amount of food was described on the basis of its size or volume.\u00b2\u2074 Exegesis 6.1 Literal Use A.1 The word \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2has the basic meaning \u2018split off\u2019, \u2018piece\u2019, \u2018part\u2019,\u00b2\u2075 and in Exod 38:26 it is a \u2018part\u2019 (from two parts) of a shekel.\u00b2\u2076 A.2 The designation \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2is mentioned as a weight in Gen 24:22: Abraham\u2019s servant gives rich gifts to Rebeccah. He takes (\u05dc\u05e7\u05d7) a golden ring (\u05e0\u05b6\u05d6\u05b6\u05dd \u05d6\u05b8\u05b8\u05d4\u05b8\u05d1), whose weight (\u05de\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05b8\u05e7\u05b8\u05dc) is a \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2, as well as two bracelets, which have ten golden shekels (\u05e2\u05b2\u05e9\u05b8\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d6\u05b8\u05b8\u05d4\u05b8\u05d1; cf. \u2192 \u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05b6\u05e7\u05b6\u05dc) as their weight. The use ofbeka weighs only a portion of a shekel. \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2for a ring, next to \u2018ten shekels\u2019 for bracelets, suggests that a a beka weighs only a portion of a shekel. A.3 In Exod 38:26 a \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2is mentioned in the context of the mention of silver (\u05db\u05b6\u05bc\u05b6\u05e1\u05b6\u05e3, Exod 38:25) belonging to the processed materials (Exod 38:24-31) in the manufacture of the tabernacle and was gathered in a census. This is referred to as a \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2in silver a head for every one who was numbered in the census from the age of twenty years old and upwards. A \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2is further referred to in 38:26 as half a shekel (\u05de\u05b7 \u05d7\u05b2\u05b4\u05e6\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea\u05d4\u05b7\ufb49\u05b6\u05c1\u05b6\u05e7\u05b6\u05dc, \u2018half of a shekel\u2019) \u2018by the sanctuary shekel\u2019 (\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05b6\u05e7\u05b6\u05dc \u2192 ,\u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05e7\u05b6\u05dc \u05d4\u05b7\u05e8\u05bc\u05b9\u05b6\u05d3\u05b6\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1). 6.2 Figurative Use Not attested. 6.3 Pictorial Material A.1 Some pictures or drawings of beka weights have been published in the literature on the subject.\u00b2\u2077 Two of these are presented below (figs. 1 and 2), of which the round, stone weight is the most usual exemplar of this weight. Figure 1: Stone beka-weight\u00b2\u2078 Figure 2: Metal beka-weight\u00b2\u2079 A.2 A First Temple period beka weight was discovered during the sifting project of archaeological soil originating from the Western Wall foundations in the Emek Tzurim National Park under auspices of the City of David Foundation. The finding is interesting, because the weight was inscribed in mirror script (see Fig.1, below), which suggests that the craftsman was used to create seals and to write in mirror script.\u00b3\u2070 [][] Figure 3: Beka weight inscribed in mirror script.\u00b3\u00b9 6.4 Archaeology A.1 Kletter mentions thirty-five weights designated with the letters \u05e7 ,\u05d1, and \u05e2(or two or one of these letters) as a \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2.\u00b3\u00b2 Their provenance is, as far as it is known, for the most part in Judah, they date from the late 8th century BCE, and later centuries and vary according to its calculation in weight from 5.51 to about 6.90 grams, with an average of 6,003 grams.\u00b3\u00b3 These weights, all homogeneous in shape, are as a rule made of stone as all weights were,\u00b3\u2074 although a metal weight is found as well.\u00b3\u2075 It is also possible to point out a number of uninscribed beka weights (6.0-6.6 grams, mostly of stone), of which it is difficult to say whether they date from the same or an earlier period.\u00b3\u2076 \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2beka (half a shekel) 5 Conclusion A.1 The \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2, \u2019half shekel\u2019, is part of a weight system that is based on the \u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05b6\u05e7\u05b6\u05dc. The fact that the found beka weights vary in weight is attributed to the existence of more than one weight standard.\u00b3\u2077 However, it can also be explained by factors such as mistakes in the manufacture of the weights, inability to accurately weigh, wear and tamper.\u00b3\u2078 Since the found beka weights originate from the same time and, as far as is known, come largely from the same area (Judaea) and are largely homogeneous in terms of material and shape, it is probable that these weights are of the same weight standard.\u00b3\u2079 It is therefore very likely that the same weight standard is to be applied to the \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2of Gen 24:22 and the one of Exod 38:26. It is true that for the \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05b7\u05e7\u05b7\u05e2of Exod 38:26, unlike that of Gen 24:22, the standard of the \u2018sanctuary shekel\u2019 applies. But the question is whether this is a standard set by the sanctuary that would deviate from that which is used in the normal use of the shekel (see \u2192 \u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05b6\u05e7\u05b6\u05dc).

In this respect the comment by Marvin Powell (Powell 1992: 905) should be kept inmind: \u2018Most surviving weight specimens are small and deviation from a given norm increases as the size of the weight decreases.\u2019 Similarly Weippert 1977: 93. \u21a9 Cf. the reference to weights as \u2018stones\u2019 (Sam 14:26; Mic 6:11; cf.

Occurrences: Total 19x OT, 0x Sir, 1x Qum (4Q217 fr12.3; plus Is 45.20 written as MT in 1QIsa^(a)), 0x inscr. Text Doubtful: A.1 Licht (1957:100) restored \u05d8[\u05e4\u05dc\u05d9] in 1QH 5.6. Delcor (1962:156) rejects this restoration, though Vermes (1997:267) translates the term \u201c[deliverance]\u201d and thus suggests a restoration similar to that of Licht: probably pall\u0113\u1e6d (infinitive piel). The reading here is too isolated and uncertain to be of semantic use. A.2 The occurrence of \u05d9]\u05d8[\u05d9]\u05e4\u05dc in 4Q217 12.3 is almost certain, and is adopted by DJD (XIII:32). This should probably be taken as p\u0101l\u012b\u1e6d rather than p\u0101l\u0113\u1e6d because of the plene spelling and because the phraseology with \u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05d1 \u2018return\u2019 seems closer to Jr 44.28 than to Jr 44.14b. B.1 BHS Ezk 24.27 suggests that \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea\u05be\u05d4\u05b7\u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 may have been added, although this suggestion has no direct textual support, and there is no obvious process for the addition of this phrase to take place. B.2 BHS Jdg 12.4 claims that much of v. 4b, including \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8, was not represented in the earliest form of the LXX, but this not semantically relevant. Qere/Ketiv: none. 1. Root and Comparative Material A.1 See \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 Qal. A.2 Ben-Hayyim (1957:559) attests \u05e4\u05dc\u05d9\u05d8 in Samaritan Hebrew. A.3 GenR 42.8 on Gn 14.13 uses \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8. B.1 Hubbard (1997:623) says that \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 \u201ccomes from\u201d the adjective \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05d9\u05d8(written with short \u201ca\u201d), though there is no evidence for this. 2. Formal Characteristics A.1 Hasel (1989:593 = 2001:555) says that the form \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 \u201centstammt einer Adjektivform\u201d, and defines it as a qati:l form (thus also HAL:880a). Barth (1894:\u00a7125e) states that this qati:l form is an active participle from an i-imperfect verb (the i-imperfect is attested in the proper name \u05d9\u05b7\u05e4\u05b0\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8 [1Ch 7.32, 33]). In contrast to Barth, Waltke & O\u2019Connor (1990:88, \u00a75.3c) suggest that in the case of \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 the form has a passive sense. B.1 [nil] 3.

A.1 Each version shows a preference for a particular root in its own language. The LXX generally translates the lexeme by a compound of or cognate of \u03c3\u1ff4\u03b6\u03c9 \u2018save\u2019. Sym usually translates by a compound of \u03c6\u03b5\u1f7b\u03b3\u03c9 \u2018flee\u2019. Pesh, when not translating by cognate \u02betpl\u1e6d, most often uses \u02betp\u1e63y \u2018be delivered\u2019. Tg generally uses \u05e9\u05c1\u05d9\u05d6\u05d1 and cognates, and Vg *fug- based words. The impression of meaning from all the versions is that the lexeme means \u201cone who is saved through flight\u201d. In addition there is some variation between translation equivalents that present the escape or flight as in the past, and those that present it in the present. A.2 The possible exceptions, where the meaning given is more negative, are \u05de\u05b0\u05e2\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05e7\u05d5\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9 in Tg at Ob 14 (\u2018fugitives, refugees\u2019) and in Vg fugitivus and some or all of the forms of fugio, \u2018flee\u2019, where there is no guarantee of a positive outcome. A.3 The versions reveal no obvious distinction between \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 and \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8. B.1 LXX in Ezk 33.22 uses \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u0301\u03bd to refer back to its rendering of \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 in v. 21 to avoid repetition. 5. Lexical/Semantic Field(s) A.1 For a discussion of the semantic field of lexemes of the root \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8, and for a contrast of these lexemes with those of the root \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 see Lexical/Semantic Field(s) of \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 piel. A.2 It has been suggested by Zorell (651a) that \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8 supplies the absolute pl of \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8, which only occurs in the absolute sing, construct pl and suffixed pl. However, this distribution may be merely a by-product of the fundamental difference these lexemes display, despite some overlap in meaning. Generally the \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 is someone who has completed his escape, whereas the \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8 is someone who is still on the move from danger or has not found a settled situation. This does not mean for either category that no danger remains. It merely identifies the relationship between the fugitive and the danger they initially flee, and the safety they seek. Thus in Gn 14.13, Ezk 24.26, 27, 33.21, 22 the \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 has essentially left the area where they were initially under threat. Of course a different threat may encounter the fugitive at this stage (e.g. Ob 14). The \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b6\u05e4\u05b0\u05e8\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd in Jdg 12.5 are in mortal danger, but have left the initial danger horizon of the battlefield. Whatever \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b6\u05e4\u05b0\u05e8\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd means in Jdg 12.4, it is clear that those denoted have left Ephraim as a horizon in the past. Likewise the \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d4\u05b7\u05d2\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd(Is 45.20), and \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8\u05b5\u05d9\u05db\u05b6\u05dd (Ezk 6.9) are those who have already survived the danger. In statements that there was/should be/will be no one who escaped/escapes, \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 is used (Josh 8.22, 2Kg 9.15, Jr 42.17, 44.14, Am 9.1, La 2.22), because this term best refers to successful escape (cf. Ezk 7.16). The difference in distribution between the two terms may also be illustrated by the distinction between \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d7\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05d1(Jr 44.28, Ezk 6.8) for whom the process of flight is complete (the danger horizon of the \u05d7\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05d1 is in the past), and the\u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05b5\u05d7\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05d1 (Jr 51.50) who are addressed as still on the run, and are encouraged not to stop. Likewise, the \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd, parallel with \u05e0\u05b8\u05e1\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd , in Jr 50.28 are still on the run. Because a \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8 is often someone who still has to journey to complete their escape, the term can take on a negative connotation (e.g. Nu 21.29). On the other hand, for the phrases negating the existence of a \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 to have a negative connotation (e.g. Josh 8.22), a \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 must be able to be an essentially positive thing. This also relieves the tension felt in Jr 44.14 where the existence of a \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 is denied, but the presence of \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd is permitted. If the latter has negative connotations and the former positive ones then both statements are to be understood as negative in tone. The existence of \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d7\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05d1in Jr 44.28 need not contradict 44.14, since \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d7\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05d1are merely those who have escaped the sword, and are not designated \u201cescaped ones\u201d in an unqualified sense. Some support for this general distinction in meanings is given by morphology. If the explanation of Waltke & O\u2019Connor is preferred to that of Barth (see Formal Characteristics A.1), and \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 is a passive participle and \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8 an active one, it would be natural for the former to take on a past time frame reference. The distinction between the lexemes need not be absolute. Thus in Am 9.1 \u05e0\u05b8\u05e1 appears in parallel to \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 suggesting that the \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 was still on the move. A.3 Parallel with \u05e9\u05c2\u05b8\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05d3 (Josh 8.22, Jr 42.17, 44.14, Ob 14, La 2.22), \u05e0\u05b8\u05e1 (Am 9.1). B.1 [nil] 6. Exegesis A.1 The exegesis of a number of individual passages is covered in Lexical/Semantic Field(s). A.2 Hasel (1974:184) believes that in Am 9.1 the terms \u05d0\u05b7\u05d7\u05b2\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea and \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 \u201cthrow light upon each other\u201d. However, the relationship between \u05e0\u05b8\u05e1 and \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 is closer. A.3 Zorell (651a) understands \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 as \u201cqui salvus seu superstes est\u201d, and Alonso Sch\u00f6kel (584b) understands it as \u201csuperviviente, evadido, escapado, fugado, fugitivo\u201d. A.4 The notion of survived danger is not at all obvious for Jdg 12.4. B.1 [nil] 7. Conclusion A.1 The \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 is generally a person who has escaped a horizon of danger. It is often to be contrasted with \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8, which depicts someone as still on the move, or unsettled. \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 does not have the negative connotations usually present in \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8. B.1 Zorell (651a) advocates the complementary nature of \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 and \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8, the latter seeming to supply the absolute pl of \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8. It has been argued in Lexical/Semantic Field(s) that this conclusion cannot be sustained. Bibliography Barth, J. \u00b21894. Die Nominalbildung in den semitischen Sprachen. Leipzig.

This should probably be taken as p\u0101l\u012b\u1e6d rather than p\u0101l\u0113\u1e6d because of the plene spelling and because the phraseology with \u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05d1 \u2018return\u2019 seems closer to Jr 44.28 than to Jr 44.14b. B.1 BHS Ezk 24.27 suggests that \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea\u05be\u05d4\u05b7\u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 may have been added, although this suggestion has no direct textual support, and there is no obvious process for the addition of this phrase to take place. B.2 BHS Jdg 12.4 claims that much of v. 4b, including \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8, was not represented in the earliest form of the LXX, but this not semantically relevant.

A.1 Each version shows a preference for a particular root in its own language. The LXX generally translates the lexeme by a compound of or cognate of \u03c3\u1ff4\u03b6\u03c9 \u2018save\u2019. Sym usually translates by a compound of \u03c6\u03b5\u1f7b\u03b3\u03c9 \u2018flee\u2019. Pesh, when not translating by cognate \u02betpl\u1e6d, most often uses \u02betp\u1e63y \u2018be delivered\u2019. Tg generally uses \u05e9\u05c1\u05d9\u05d6\u05d1 and cognates, and Vg *fug- based words. The impression of meaning from all the versions is that the lexeme means \u201cone who is saved through flight\u201d. In addition there is some variation between translation equivalents that present the escape or flight as in the past, and those that present it in the present. A.2 The possible exceptions, where the meaning given is more negative, are \u05de\u05b0\u05e2\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05e7\u05d5\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9 in Tg at Ob 14 (\u2018fugitives, refugees\u2019) and in Vg fugitivus and some or all of the forms of fugio, \u2018flee\u2019, where there is no guarantee of a positive outcome. A.3 The versions reveal no obvious distinction between \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 and \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8.

Versions"},{"location":"words/refugee/#5-lexicalsemantic-fields","text":"A.1 For a discussion of the semantic field of lexemes of the root \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8, and for a contrast of these lexemes with those of the root \u05de\u05dc\u05d8 see Lexical/Semantic Field(s) of \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8 piel. A.2 It has been suggested by Zorell (651a) that \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8 supplies the absolute pl of \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8, which only occurs in the absolute sing, construct pl and suffixed pl. However, this distribution may be merely a by-product of the fundamental difference these lexemes display, despite some overlap in meaning. Generally the \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 is someone who has completed his escape, whereas the \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8 is someone who is still on the move from danger or has not found a settled situation. This does not mean for either category that no danger remains. It merely identifies the relationship between the fugitive and the danger they initially flee, and the safety they seek. Thus in Gn 14.13, Ezk 24.26, 27, 33.21, 22 the \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 has essentially left the area where they were initially under threat. Of course a different threat may encounter the fugitive at this stage (e.g. Ob 14). The \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b6\u05e4\u05b0\u05e8\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd in Jdg 12.5 are in mortal danger, but have left the initial danger horizon of the battlefield. Whatever \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b6\u05e4\u05b0\u05e8\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd means in Jdg 12.4, it is clear that those denoted have left Ephraim as a horizon in the past. Likewise the \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d4\u05b7\u05d2\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd(Is 45.20), and \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8\u05b5\u05d9\u05db\u05b6\u05dd (Ezk 6.9) are those who have already survived the danger. In statements that there was/should be/will be no one who escaped/escapes, \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 is used (Josh 8.22, 2Kg 9.15, Jr 42.17, 44.14, Am 9.1, La 2.22), because this term best refers to successful escape (cf. Ezk 7.16). The difference in distribution between the two terms may also be illustrated by the distinction between \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d7\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05d1(Jr 44.28, Ezk 6.8) for whom the process of flight is complete (the danger horizon of the \u05d7\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05d1 is in the past), and the\u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05b5\u05d7\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05d1 (Jr 51.50) who are addressed as still on the run, and are encouraged not to stop. Likewise, the \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd, parallel with \u05e0\u05b8\u05e1\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd , in Jr 50.28 are still on the run. Because a \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8 is often someone who still has to journey to complete their escape, the term can take on a negative connotation (e.g. Nu 21.29). On the other hand, for the phrases negating the existence of a \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 to have a negative connotation (e.g. Josh 8.22), a \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 must be able to be an essentially positive thing. This also relieves the tension felt in Jr 44.14 where the existence of a \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 is denied, but the presence of \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd is permitted. If the latter has negative connotations and the former positive ones then both statements are to be understood as negative in tone. The existence of \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d7\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05d1in Jr 44.28 need not contradict 44.14, since \u05e4\u05bc\u05b0\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d7\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05d1are merely those who have escaped the sword, and are not designated \u201cescaped ones\u201d in an unqualified sense. Some support for this general distinction in meanings is given by morphology. If the explanation of Waltke & O\u2019Connor is preferred to that of Barth (see Formal Characteristics A.1), and \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 is a passive participle and \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8 an active one, it would be natural for the former to take on a past time frame reference. The distinction between the lexemes need not be absolute. Thus in Am 9.1 \u05e0\u05b8\u05e1 appears in parallel to \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 suggesting that the \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 was still on the move. A.3 Parallel with \u05e9\u05c2\u05b8\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05d3 (Josh 8.22, Jr 42.17, 44.14, Ob 14, La 2.22), \u05e0\u05b8\u05e1 (Am 9.1). B.1 [nil]","title":"5.

A.2 Hasel (1974:184) believes that in Am 9.1 the terms \u05d0\u05b7\u05d7\u05b2\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea and \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 \u201cthrow light upon each other\u201d.

A.3 Zorell (651a) understands \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 as \u201cqui salvus seu superstes est\u201d, and Alonso Sch\u00f6kel (584b) understands it as \u201csuperviviente, evadido, escapado, fugado, fugitivo\u201d.

It is often to be contrasted with \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8, which depicts someone as still on the move, or unsettled. \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 does not have the negative connotations usually present in \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8. B.1 Zorell (651a) advocates the complementary nature of \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8 and \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05d8, the latter seeming to supply the absolute pl of \u05e4\u05bc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8.
